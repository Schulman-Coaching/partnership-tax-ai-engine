# Partnership Tax Logic Engine - Deployment Status

**Date:** September 7, 2025  
**Status:** Infrastructure Deployed, Application Deployment In Progress

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Partnership Tax Logic Engine is an AI-powered platform that automates partnership tax compliance, featuring:
- AI document parsing for partnership agreements
- Section 704(b) capital account management
- Target allocation calculations
- Compliance validation and audit trails

## ✅ Completed Successfully

### 1. MVP Development
- **Backend:** FastAPI with Python, PostgreSQL, AI/ML integration
- **Frontend:** Next.js with React, Tailwind CSS
- **Database Models:** Partnership, Document, Capital Account structures
- **AI Services:** OpenAI GPT-4 document parsing
- **API Endpoints:** Complete REST API for all core functionality

### 2. AWS Infrastructure Deployment
- **ECS Cluster:** `partnership-tax-engine-cluster` (ACTIVE)
- **RDS PostgreSQL:** `partnership-tax-engine-db` (Available)
- **ElastiCache Redis:** Deployed and running
- **Application Load Balancer:** `partnership-tax-engine-alb` (Active)
  - URL: `partnership-tax-engine-alb-281971340.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com`
- **ECR Repositories:** Created for backend and frontend
- **VPC, Security Groups, IAM:** All configured properly

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Fixes
- **GitHub Actions Workflow:** Configured with automated testing and deployment
- **Test Suite:** Created backend pytest tests and frontend test script
- **Dependencies:** Fixed pytest-cov and PostgreSQL role issues
- **Latest Commit:** `055dea7` - "Fix GitHub Actions test failures"

## 🔄 Current Status

### Infrastructure State
```
✅ ECS Cluster: Active (0 services, 0 tasks)
✅ RDS Database: Available
✅ Load Balancer: Active
✅ ECR Repositories: Created (empty)
⏳ ECS Services: Not deployed yet
⏳ Docker Images: Not built yet
```

### GitHub Actions Status
- **Latest Workflow:** Completed in 3m 8s for commit 055dea7
- **Test Phase:** ✅ PASSING (fixed all test failures)
- **Build Phase:** ❌ FAILING (Docker build issues)
- **Deploy Phase:** Not reached yet

## 🚧 Remaining Issues

### Primary Blocker: Docker Build Failures
The GitHub Actions workflow is now passing tests but failing during the Docker build phase. This prevents:
- Docker images from being pushed to ECR
- ECS task definitions from being created
- ECS services from being deployed
- Application from being accessible

### Potential Build Issues
1. **Dockerfile Configuration:** Missing or incorrect Dockerfiles
2. **Build Context:** Build context may be incorrect
3. **Dependencies:** Docker build dependencies issues
4. **Platform Compatibility:** ARM64 vs AMD64 platform issues

## 🎯 Next Steps (When Resuming)

### Immediate Actions
1. **Debug Docker Build Issues**
   - Verify Dockerfile exists for backend and frontend
   - Check Docker build context and dependencies
   - Test Docker builds locally if needed

2. **Fix Build Pipeline**
   - Resolve Docker build failures in GitHub Actions
   - Ensure images push successfully to ECR

3. **Complete Deployment**
   - ECS task definitions will be created automatically
   - ECS services will deploy automatically
   - Application will be accessible via load balancer

### Expected Timeline
- **Docker Build Fix:** 1-2 hours
- **Full Deployment:** Additional 30 minutes
- **Testing & Validation:** 30 minutes
