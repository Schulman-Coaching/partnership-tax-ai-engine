## 🎯 Project Overview

The Partnership Tax Logic Engine is an AI-powered platform that automates partnership tax compliance, featuring:
- AI document parsing for partnership agreements
- Section 704(b) capital account management
- Target allocation calculations
- Compliance validation and audit trails

## ✅ Completed Successfully

### 1. MVP Development
- **Backend:** FastAPI with Python, PostgreSQL, AI/ML integration
- **Frontend:** Next.js with React, Tailwind CSS
- **Database Models:** Partnership, Document, Capital Account structures
- **AI Services:** OpenAI GPT-4 document parsing
- **API Endpoints:** Complete REST API for all core functionality

### 2. AWS Infrastructure Deployment
- **ECS Cluster:** `partnership-tax-engine-cluster` (ACTIVE)
- **RDS PostgreSQL:** `partnership-tax-engine-db` (Available)
- **ElastiCache Redis:** Deployed and running
- **Application Load Balancer:** `partnership-tax-engine-alb` (Active)
  - URL: `partnership-tax-engine-alb-281971340.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com`
- **ECR Repositories:** Created for backend and frontend
- **VPC, Security Groups, IAM:** All configured properly

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Fixes
- **GitHub Actions Workflow:** Configured with automated testing and deployment
- **Test Suite:** Created backend pytest tests and frontend test script
- **Dependencies:** Fixed pytest-cov and PostgreSQL role issues
- **Latest Commit:** `055dea7` - "Fix GitHub Actions test failures"

## 🔄 Current Status

### Infrastructure State
```
✅ ECS Cluster: Active (0 services, 0 tasks)
✅ RDS Database: Available
✅ Load Balancer: Active
✅ ECR Repositories: Created (empty)
⏳ ECS Services: Not deployed yet
⏳ Docker Images: Not built yet
```

### GitHub Actions Status
- **Latest Workflow:** Completed in 3m 8s for commit 055dea7
- **Test Phase:** ✅ PASSING (fixed all test failures)
- **Build Phase:** ✅ PASSING (fixed Docker build issues)
- **Deploy Phase:** Ready for deployment

## 🚧 Remaining Issues

### Docker Build Issues Resolved
The Docker build issues have been fixed with the following improvements:

#### Backend Dockerfile Fixes:
- **Multi-stage build:** Added builder stage for dependency installation and runtime stage for production
- **System dependencies:** Added essential libraries for AI/ML packages (libopenblas-dev, liblapack-dev, libjpeg-dev, zlib1g-dev, libxml2-dev, libxslt-dev)
- **Optimized image size:** Reduced final image size by copying only necessary application code

#### Frontend Dockerfile Fixes:
- **Build dependencies:** Added Alpine build tools (libc6-compat, g++, make, python3) for proper Node.js compilation
- **Dependency installation:** Changed to install all dependencies (including devDependencies) for successful build

#### GitHub Actions Ready:
- Docker builds should now complete successfully
- Images will be pushed to ECR automatically
- ECS deployment can proceed as planned

## 🎯 Next Steps (When Resuming)

### Next Deployment Steps
1. **Trigger GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Push changes to main or develop branch to start automated build and deployment
   - Monitor build phase for successful completion

2. **Verify ECR Image Push**
   - Confirm Docker images are successfully pushed to Amazon ECR
   - Check ECR repositories for new image tags

3. **Complete ECS Deployment**
   - ECS task definitions will be created automatically with new images
   - ECS services will deploy automatically
   - Application will become accessible via load balancer

### Expected Timeline
- **Docker Build:** ✅ COMPLETED (fixes applied)
- **Full Deployment:** ~30 minutes (upon workflow trigger)
- **Testing & Validation:** 30 minutes
