# Partnership Tax Logic Engine - MVP Specifications

## Product Overview
**Vision:** AI-powered "logic engine" that automates the most technically demanding aspects of partnership tax compliance, positioning as a specialized system of intelligence that integrates with incumbent tax software platforms.

## Phase 1 MVP: Partnership Agreement Parser & Section 704(b) Automation

### Core Features

#### 1. NLP-Powered Partnership Agreement Analysis
**Input:** Partnership/LLC operating agreements (PDF format)
**Output:** Structured JSON data containing key economic terms

**Key Extraction Capabilities:**
- Partner/member names and ownership percentages
- Capital contribution requirements and schedules
- Distribution waterfall logic (preferred returns, catch-up provisions, promote structures)
- Management fee structures
- Special allocation provisions
- Liquidation preferences and procedures
- Deficit restoration obligations (DRO) and Qualified Income Offset (QIO) provisions

**Technical Requirements:**
- Support for 100+ page complex agreements
- Handle variations in legal language and formatting
- Extract data from tables, schedules, and exhibits
- Confidence scoring for each extracted element
- Manual review interface for low-confidence extractions

#### 2. Section 704(b) Capital Account Maintenance
**Input:** 
- Parsed partnership agreement data
- Monthly/quarterly financial transactions
- Partner-specific adjustments

**Processing:**
- Automatic maintenance of Section 704(b) book capital accounts
- Track contributions, distributions, and allocated items
- Handle complex allocation methods (layers, tiers, waterfalls)
- Generate year-end target capital account calculations
- Validate substantial economic effect compliance

**Output:**
- Monthly capital account statements by partner
- Year-end Schedule K-1 allocation recommendations
- Compliance risk alerts and recommendations

#### 3. Target Allocation Engine
**Core Function:** Reverse-engineer income/loss allocations to achieve target capital account balances

**Process:**
1. Model hypothetical liquidation based on agreement waterfall
2. Calculate target ending capital account for each partner
3. Determine required income/loss allocations to reach targets
4. Generate allocation percentages for tax software input
5. Provide detailed backup calculations for audit defense

### Integration Capabilities
